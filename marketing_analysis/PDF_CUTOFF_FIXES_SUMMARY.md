# PDF Horizontal Cutoff Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PDF Page Margins
**Problem**: Charts were being cut off due to narrow PDF margins
**Solution**: 
- Increased PDF margins from 12mm to 15mm left/right
- Increased CSS @page margins from 15mm to 18mm left/right
- Increased PDF scale from 0.8 to 0.85 for better readability

### 2. Chart Spacing Configuration
**Problem**: Charts had insufficient spacing causing content to be cut off at edges
**Solution**: 
- Increased all chart `spacingLeft` from 15-20px to 40-45px
- Increased all chart `spacingRight` from 15-20px to 40-45px
- Added extra spacing for legends and labels

### 3. Month Label Truncation
**Problem**: X-axis labels like "Aug-24" were being cut to "Au" or "A"
**Solution**:
- Shortened month categories from "Jan-24, Feb-24..." to just "Jan, Feb..."
- Added year divider lines with "2024 | 2025" labels for clarity
- Maintained data accuracy while improving readability

### 4. ROAS Label Overlap
**Problem**: ROAS values displaying as "44.57x .57x" instead of clean "4.57x"
**Solution**:
- Added `allowOverlap: false` to dataLabels configuration
- Added `padding: 5` to dataLabels for proper spacing
- Increased chart spacing to accommodate labels properly

### 5. Legend Positioning Optimization
**Problem**: Legends being cut off on the right side
**Solution**:
- Added `itemWidth` settings to prevent text cutoff (100-120px)
- Added `maxHeight` settings to control legend overflow
- Ensured all legends fit within chart boundaries

### 6. Chart Container Improvements
**Problem**: Chart containers not providing enough space for content
**Solution**:
- Increased padding from 20px-25px to 20px-30px
- Improved box-sizing and overflow handling
- Added more generous spacing for all chart types
