## ðŸ“Š Chart Commentary Examples

### Weekly CAC Trends
*"CAC increased by 4.5% from $756 to $790. CAC remains relatively stable."*

### Monthly Analysis  
*"2025-07 CAC of $780 vs $703 in 2025-06 (+10.9% MoM). Higher CAC during growth periods. Historical range: $471-$786 indicates significant seasonal and growth-driven variability."*

### Scaling Impact
*"Modest spend increases (+10%) result in 1.5% CAC inflation, while aggressive scaling (+100%) drives 15% CAC increases. Model assumes 0.15% elasticity coefficient based on diminishing returns as quality traffic becomes scarcer."*

### Regional Distribution
*"US dominates with 78.2% of total new member orders (46,729 orders). Top markets: US, EU, GB represent 88.8% of volume. International expansion shows promise in EU and GB markets."*

### Regional Growth
*"Growth leaders: EU (+17.4%), CH (+13.6%), GB (+9.0%). Declining markets: Other (-83.3%), MX (-47.5%), ME (-43.4%). US market decline (-14.9%) may indicate seasonal patterns or increased competition, while EU growth (+17.4%) suggests successful international expansion."*

### Customer Lifecycle
*"Member upgrades averaging 17 orders/day drive incremental revenue. Subscription renewals generate ~$57K daily recurring revenue. Strong retention metrics indicate healthy customer satisfaction and product-market fit."*

## ðŸ”§ Technical Fixes

    Highcharts.chart('weeklyProjectionChart', config);
