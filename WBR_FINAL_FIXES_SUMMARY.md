# WBR Report - Final Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ All Issues Resolved

### **1. Monthly KPI Change Calculations Fixed**
**Issue:** All monthly KPI changes were hardcoded to 0%
**Solution:** Implemented proper month-over-month calculations

**Before:**
```javascript
{
    title: 'Monthly Revenue',
    value: formatCurrency(currentMonth.bookings || 0),
    change: 0,  // ‚ùå Hardcoded
    prefix: ''
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Calculate month-over-month changes
const revenueChange = ((currentMonth.bookings - previousMonth.bookings) / previousMonth.bookings * 100);

{
    title: 'Monthly Revenue', 
    value: formatCurrency(currentMonth.bookings || 0),
    change: revenueChange,  // ‚úÖ Calculated
    prefix: ''
}
```

**Results:**
- **Orders Change:** -12.2% (3,840 vs 4,376)
- **Revenue Change:** -24.0% ($19.9M vs $26.2M) 
- **Spend Change:** -21.5% ($2.7M vs $3.4M)
- **CAC Change:** -10.5% ($703 vs $786)

### **2. Monthly Comparison Labels Clarified**
**Issue:** Generic "Current vs Previous Month" label was confusing
**Solution:** Updated to explicit "June 2025 vs May 2025" comparison

**Before:** `<span class="kpi-period-comparison">Current vs Previous Month</span>`
**After:** `<span class="kpi-period-comparison">June 2025 vs May 2025</span>`

### **3. Weekly KPI Calculations Verified**
**Status:** ‚úÖ Already accurate - no changes needed
**Verified calculations:**
- **Orders Change:** -21.7% (859 vs 1,097)
- **Bookings Change:** -18.6% ($4.68M vs $5.75M)
- **Spend Change:** -18.2% ($678K vs $829K)
- **CAC Change:** +4.5% ($790 vs $756)

### **4. 4-Week CAC Projection Chart Loading Fixed**
**Issue:** Chart not rendering due to race condition from duplicate creation calls
**Solution:** Removed immediate execution, kept only staggered timeout approach

**Before:**
```javascript
// Line 737 - Immediate execution
createWeeklyProjectionChart();

// Line 846 - Delayed execution  
setTimeout(() => createWeeklyProjectionChart(), 2800);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Only delayed execution remains
setTimeout(() => createWeeklyProjectionChart(), 2800);
```

### **5. Donut Chart Converted to Column Bar Chart**
**Issue:** Pie/donut chart difficult for regional comparison
**Solution:** Converted to column chart with proper axes

**Before:**
```javascript
chart: { type: 'pie', height: 450 },
series: [{
    name: 'Orders',
    size: '80%',
    innerSize: '40%',  // Donut style
    dataLabels: {
        format: '{point.name}: {point.percentage:.1f}%'
    }
}]
```

**After:**
```javascript
chart: { type: 'column', height: 450 },
xAxis: {
    categories: data.regions,
    labels: { rotation: -45 }
},
yAxis: {
    title: { text: 'Number of Orders' }
},
series: [{
    name: 'Orders',
    dataLabels: {
        format: '{point.y:,.0f}',
        enabled: true
    }
}]
```
