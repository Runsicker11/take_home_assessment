## 🎯 CAC Forecast Model

The forecasting model uses historical channel elasticity to project realistic scenarios:

| Spend Increase | Monthly Spend | Additional Spend | New CAC | CAC Increase |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|---------|--------------|
| +10% | $2.05M | +$186K/month | $825 | +4.0% |
| +20% | $2.23M | +$372K/month | $858 | +8.2% |
| +30% | $2.42M | +$558K/month | $895 | +12.9% |
| +50% | $2.79M | +$930K/month | $960 | +21.1% |
| +100% | $3.72M | +$1.86M/month | $1,190 | +50.1% |

**Methodology**: Based on observed market behavior with channel elasticity factor of 0.4 and diminishing returns at scale.
