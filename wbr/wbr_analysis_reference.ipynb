    "\n",
    "## Data Transformations Applied\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number Formatting\n",
    "- Large numbers: 3565000 → \"3.5M\" for amounts >= 1M\n",
    "- Medium numbers: 1250 → \"1,250\" with comma separators\n",
    "- Currency formatting with appropriate scale\n",
    "\n",
    "### CAC Forecast Model\n",
    "- **Baseline**: $793 (8-week average)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Report Generation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Processing**: Load and validate JSON data\n",
    "2. **Chart Generation**: Create 6 Highcharts visualizations\n",
    "3. **Commentary Population**: Generate data-driven insights\n",
    "4. **PDF Export**: Use Puppeteer for high-quality PDF generation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Files Structure\n",
    "- `wbr_report_puppeteer.html` - Final report template\n",
    "- `test_pdf_simple.js` - PDF generation script\n",

    "\n",
    "The CAC forecast model uses historical performance data to project realistic scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Assumptions:\n",
    "1. **Channel Elasticity**: 0.4 (40% of spend increase translates to CAC increase)\n",
    "2. **Market Saturation**: Accelerating CAC increases beyond 30% spend increase\n",
    "3. **Competition Effects**: Higher spend triggers competitive responses\n",
    "4. **Audience Quality Decline**: Diminishing returns on incremental spend\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario Calculations:\n",
    "- **Baseline**: $793 (current 8-week average)\n",
    "- **10% increase**: +4.0% CAC increase → $825\n",
    "- **20% increase**: +8.2% CAC increase → $858\n",
